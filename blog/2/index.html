        So you may know what HTML is? It is a programming language to organize
        your text. Like adding context and structure. Well what is programming
        then? "a programming language allows you to describe some sort of
        process of doing something, " Thanks to stack overflow for that
        definition. <br /><br />
        Let's think about it, in python you can create a process or do something
        like running a function and collecting user input. But in HTML you can
        collect input as a form but then you can't do anything with that data
        unless you have Javascript. Another example: CSS is used to style and
        create but since it doesn't create process or run functions it is not a
        programming language. Since html and css is a way of adding context and
        structure to text and styling it, it is not a
        <b>offical coding language</b> Don't be bummed though, more complex
        things involving HTML like Javascript, and Ajax then those are
        considered a offical <b>programming language</b>
